<p>The former Bayern player is having some issues with the club presently with just a year left on his contract.<br> I really hope this is true because i am pretty sure <strong>Gnabry</strong> is going to boost our attack and give <em> the team </em> enough options going forward</strong></p>
<h3>JESUS</h3>

<p>With the useless players loosing the top4 to our rivary <strong>(Tothenham)</strong> I don't think Arsenal would be his top <span> <orange>priority right now</></span> because he's use to <em>UCL</em> footbball.<br>Well! I bliv with money everything is possible. If Edu and Arteta can connvince him (Jesus) I am pretty sure he's going to bang alot of goals for AFC</p>
